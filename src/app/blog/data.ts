Face shape is one of the most overlooked—and most impactful—parts of personal style. Each shape, from classic oval to uncommon diamond, changes how accessories and styles interact with your unique features.

An oval face suits nearly any frame or hairstyle, while square faces may want rounded glasses and softer cuts. Oblong faces befit layers and width, and heart-shaped faces highlight their cheekbones best with side-swept styles.

Armed with the right knowledge, you can choose looks that aren’t just fashionable, but truly boost your confidence. It’s not about beauty standards—it's about unlocking your best self, starting with the shape the world sees first.`,
